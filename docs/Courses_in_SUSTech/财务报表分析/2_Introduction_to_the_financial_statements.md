# Introduction to the financial statements
In this Chapter we will go through 4 Statements.

- **What** are the financial statements telling us? 
- How are the financial statements **organized**?
- How are book value and earnings **measured**? 
- How do accounting rules **affect** price-to-book ratios and price-earnings ratios?

## Balance Sheet
$$
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' \ Equity 
$$


## Income Sheet

***What does high gross margin rate mean?***

The product has competitive advantage.

***Is there any costs associated with disclosing high gross margin rate?***

pressure from customers & Government, so not going public perhaps is a choice

### The Components of the Income Statement

$\text{Net Revenue}$

$- \text{ Cost of Goods Sold}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\pmb{\text{Gross Margin}}$

$- \text{ Operating Expenses}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\pmb{\text{Operating Income (EBIT)}}$

$- \text{ Interest Expense}$

$+ \text{ Interest Income}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\text{Income before Taxes}$

$- \text{ Income Taxes}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\text{Income before Extraordinary Items}$

$+ \text{ Extraordinary Items}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\pmb{\text{Net Income (NI)}}$

$- \pmb{\text{ Preferred Dividends}}$

$\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }$

$\text{Net Income Available to Common Shareholder}$


> [!TIP|label:Extraordinary Items]
> Extraordinary items consisted of gains or losses from events that were unusual and infrequent in nature that were separately classified, presented and disclosed on companies' financial statements. Extraordinary items were **usually explained further in the notes to the financial statements**. Companies showed an extraordinary item separately from their operating earnings because it was typically a **one-time gain or loss** and was not expected to recur in the future.

### <mark> Example </mark>

**(1)** From the following information for the year 2012, prepare an income statement and a statement of shareholders' equity, under GAAP rules (R&D expenses are expensed as incurred), for a company with shareholders' equity at the beginning of 2012 of $3,270 million. Amounts are in millions.
> GAAP is used in America, while IFRS is the international version. China uses a version closed to IFRS.

Also calculate comprehensive income and net payout. Income taxes are negative. How can this be?

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Gross Margin} &= 4458-3348 = 1110  \\
\text{EBIT} &= \text{Gross Margin} - 1230-450 = -570 \\
\text{NI} &= \text{EBIT} - (-200) = -370
\end{aligned}$$

> [!TIP|label:Comprehensive Income]
> It includes all revenues, gains, expenses, and losses incurred during a period as well as **unrealized gains and losses** during an accounting period. In this sense, it gives external users a full view of all the accounts that affect equity during a period.

> [!TIP|label:Share Issue]
> A share issue refers to the process of a company releasing shares to sell either to existing shareholders or the public. 

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Comprehensive Income} &=  \text{NI + Other comprehensive earnings} \\
&=-370 + 76 = -294 \\
\text{Net Payout} &= \text{Pay} - \text{Receive} \\
&= 140-680 = -540 \\
\text{Ending Equity} &= 3270 + \text{Comprehensive Income} - \text{Net Payout} \\
&= 3516
\end{aligned}$$

> [!NOTE]
> Total Earning 等价于 Comprehensive Earnings，但不等价于Net income。


**(2) Using Accounting Relations to Check Errors.**

A chief executive reported the following numbers for fiscal year 2012 to an annual meeting of shareholders (in millions):
Show that at least one of these numbers must be wrong because it does not obey accounting relations.

<div align = 'center'>

![](../image/20230221FS2.png)
</div>

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Given ending equity} &= 4340-1380 = 2960 \\
\text{Comprehensive Income} &= 2300-150-90=2060 \\
\text{Net Payout} &= 150+400-900 = -350\\
\text{Calculated ending equity} &= \text{beginning equity} + \text{comprehensive income + net payout} \\
&= 19140+2060-(-350)=21550
\end{aligned}$$

## Intrinsic Value, Market Value, and Book Value

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Intrinsic Premium} &= \text{Intrinsic Value of Equity- Book Value of Equity} \\
\text{Market Premium} &= \text{Market Value of Equity- Book Value of Equity}
\end{aligned}$$

### PB ratio
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Price-to-Book ratio} &= {\text{Market Value of Equity} \over \text{Book Value of Equity}} \\
\text{Intrinsic Price-to-Book ratio} &= {\text{Intrinsic Value of Equity} \over \text{Book Value of Equity}}
\end{aligned}$$


### PB discussion
**(1) Can P/B lower that 1? Why?**

可以，因为存在表外负债，以及高估资产价值（60万的商品计100万，大大高估B）。

> [!NOTE|label:注意]
> 因此，low P/B don't always mean undervalue.

**(2) 为何中国P/B平均高于美国？**
<div align = 'center'>

![](../image/20230221FS3.png)
</div>

GDP增速更快，因此全国范围内的企业整体上More Growth，赋予更多溢价【price is about future】，类似于成长股

**(3) Why Information Technology and HealthCare have bigger P/B?**
<div align = 'center'>

![](../image/20230221FS4.png)
</div>

- IT more growth like China
- HealthCare has more R&D, which is not included in B till it's products go public, but the market will credit it and give a high price.

**(4) Why B should smaller than P?**
- 会计谨慎性原则用于计算B
- 会计面向过去（B），市场面向未来（P），因此，预期成分包含一定溢价

### Measuring Value Added

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Stock Return (Market Value added)} &= \text{Ending Value - Beginning Value + Divdend} \\
&= P_t - P_{t-1} + d_t \\
\text{Accounting Value added} &= \text{Ending Book Value - Beginning Book Value + Net Payout}\\
&= \pmb{\text{Comprehensive Earnings}}
\end{aligned}$$


### Principles of Earnings Measurement
(1) Recognize value added only when you have a **customer【？】**

**Revenue recognition principles**
- Add value when it has been earned: 
   1. the earnings process is substantially accomplished; 
   2. receipt of cash is reasonably certain

**Matching principle**
  - Match expenses against revenue for which they are incurred

(2) $\text{Accounting value added (earnings)} = \text{Revenue – Expenses}$



## Matching
### Good Matching 
- Only **costs of good sold**, not the full costs of producing or buying inventory,  are matched to sales revenue during the period. 
  - Thus, gross margin (Revenue – Cost of good sold) measures value added from trading with customers.  
- Costs for goods not sold are reported in the balance sheet, as **inventory**, to be matched with revenue in future periods when the inventory is sold. 
- **Costs of buying plant** are not expensed when incurred. Rather, the cost is **“capitalized”** on the balance sheet and **depreciated** over years when the plant produces revenues
  - Depreciation is a method of matching the cost of plant to the revenues the plant generates. 
- Employee pension costs are recorded as an **expense in the period that employees generate revenues**, not when they are paid (in retirement).


### Bad Matching 
- **Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred**, rather than matched to (subsequent) revenues they generate.
- **Advertising and promotion costs are expensed when incurred**, rather than matched to (subsequent) revenues they generate.
> [!NOTE]
> What is the consequence of the above two matchings? 【the cash flow is changed】 <br>
> Why do the above poor matchings still exist? 【in case of manipulating】

- Estimating **useful lives** for plant assets that are **too long**: Depreciation is understated

## Leverage and Accounting Adjustment Ratios

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Unlevered Price/Sales ratio} &= {\text{Market Value of Equity + Net Debt} \over \text{Sales}} \\
\text{Unlevered Price/EBIT} &= {\text{Market Value of Equity + Net Debt} \over \text{EBIT}} \\
\text{Unlevered Price/EBITDA} &= {\text{Market Value of Equity + Net Debt} \over \text{EBITDA}} \\
\text{Enterprise P/B} &= {\text{Market Value of Equity + Net Debt} \over \text{Book Value of Equity + Net Debt}} 
\end{aligned}$$
> [!NOTE]
> the unlevered ratios are for the whole enterprise, the denominator is always the enterprise value. 

$$
\text{Enterprise value}=\text{Equity value+Net debt(+\pmb{Minority interest})}
$$

## Conceptual Questions
***Explain the difference between net income and net income available to common. Which definition of income is used in earnings-per-share calculations?***

Net income available to common is net income minus preferred dividends. The earnings
per share calculation uses net income available to common (divided by shares outstanding)


***Why might a firm trade at a price-to-book ratio (P/B) greater than 1.0?***

1. The firm is mispriced in the market
2.  The firm is carrying assets on its balance sheet at less than market value, or is omitting other assets like brand assets and knowledge assets. Historical cost accounting and the immediate expensing of R&D and expenditures on brand creation produce balance sheets that are likely to be below market value.


***Explain why some firms have high price-earnings (PIE) ratios***

P/E ratios indicate growth in earnings. The numerator (price) is based on expected future
earnings whereas the denominator is current earnings. If future earnings are expected to be
higher than current earnings (that is, growth in earnings is expected), the P/E will be high. (If
future earnings are expected to be lower, the P/E ratio will be low). P/E ratios can **also** be high
because the market is too optimistic in its earnings growth foreasts.


***Give some examples in which there is poor matching of revenues and expenses.***

1. Expensing research and development expenditures
2. The depreciation is understated or overstated
3. Underestimating bad debts
4. Expensing advertising and brand creation costs


***Why are dividends not an expense in the income statement?***

Dividends are distributions of the value created in a firm; they are **not a loss** in
generating value. So accountants calculate the value added (earnings), add it to equity, and then
treat dividends as a distribution of the value added (by charging dividends against equity in the
balance sheet).
