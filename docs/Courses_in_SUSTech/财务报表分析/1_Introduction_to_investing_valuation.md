# Introduction to investing, valuation

In this chapter, you will learn:
* **Who** invests in firms and **what** analysis do they need? 
* How is **fundamental investing** different from other **investment styles**?
* What is the role of the professional **analyst**? 
* How are business analysis and financial statement analysis **connected**?


## Users of Firms’ Financial Information (**Demand Side**)
- Equity Investors
  - Investment analysis
  - Management performance evaluation
- Debt Investors
  - Probability of default
  - Determination of lending rates
  - Covenant violations
- **Management** (insiders; management accounting)
  - Strategic planning
  - Investment in operations
  - Evaluation of **subordinates**
- Employees
  - Security and remuneration
- **Litigants**
  - Disputes over value in the firm
- Customers
  - Security of supply
- Governments
  - Policy making
  - Regulation
  - Taxation
  - Government contracting
- Competitors



## Investment Style
* Intuitive Investing
  * Rely on intuition(no analysis, ALL IN!)
* Passive Investing 
  * Accept the market, which is a '**Market Efficient**' Approach
* **Fundamental** Investing: Challenge market prices (Fundamental investor)
  * Active investing (Active investor)：to find mispriced investments
  * Defensive investing (Defensive investor): a defense against paying the wrong price (or selling at the wrong price)


## Cost of Each Approach
- Danger in intuitive approach:
  - Self deception
- Danger in passive approach:
  - Price is what you pay, value is what you get
  - Passive investor is in danger if the stocks are mispriced, i.e., the market is not efficient
- Fundamental analysis:
  - Requires work ! (The costs to collect, process, and analyze information, including taking this course!)

> [!TIP]
> When information is costly, is it possible that the market is efficient? Why?

**Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox**: if prices perfectly reflected available information, there is no profit to gathering information(cause there is no misprice), in which case there would be little reason to trade and markets would eventually collapse.【？】



## Alpha and Betas
- Beta Technologies
  - risk-based return
  - Example: CAPM
- Alpha Technologies
  - abnormal return by exploiting the arbitrage opportunity from mispricing

Passive investment needs a beta technology (except for index investing) .
**Fundamental investing needs both a beta and an alpha technology**.

## Risk and Return

- **Fundamental risk** is the risk that results from business operations (Passive investors also see this)
- **Price risk** is the risk of trading at the wrong price (Fundamental investors see this) : Paying too much or Selling for too little

## Business Activities
- **Financing Activities**: 
  - Raising cash from investors and returning cash to investors

- **Investing Activities**: 
  - Investing cash raised from investors in operational assets

- **Operating Activities**: 
  - Utilizing investments to produce and sell products

> [!NOTE]
> Need to know how to differentiate


## Valuation
### Firm Valuation
#### Formula
$$
\text{Value of the Firm} = \text{Value of Debt} + \text{Value of Equity}
$$
Typically, valuation of debt is a relatively easy task.

#### Example

![](../image/20230215FS2.png)

You may think the answer is just the sum of the numbers listed by using the formula above. However, the value of equity does not equal to stockholder's equity which is a book value.

The value of debt is just $\text{\textdollar}8,406+\text{\textdollar}14,512=\text{\textdollar}22,918 \text{ million}$ while the value of equity is $\text{\textdollar}41\times 2,126 \text{ million} = \text{\textdollar}87,166 \text{ million}$



#### Formula
$$
\text{Value} = \text{Anchor} + \text{Extra Value}
$$

#### Example
A firm reports book value of shareholders' equity of $\text{\textdollar}850 \text{ million}$ with $25 \text{ million}$ shares outstanding. Those shares trade at $\text{\textdollar}45$ each in the stock market. An analyst values the equity by setting the book value as an anchor. She calculates extra value of $\text{\textdollar}675 \text{ million}$. Should she issue a buy or a sell recommendation to her clients?

The analyst evaluates the equity value as $\text{\textdollar}850 \text{ million} + \text{\textdollar}675 \text{ million} = \text{\textdollar}1,525 \text{ million}$. Under this valuation, the price of the stock should be $\frac{\text{\textdollar}1,525 \text{ million}}{25 \text{ million}}=\text{\textdollar}61$, which is higher than the current price. Thus, she should issue a buy recommendation.

## Conceptual Questions
***What is the difference between fundamental risk and price risk?***

**Fundamental risk** arises from the inherent risk in the business – from sales revenue falling or expenses rising unexpectedly, for example. **Price risk** is the risk of prices deviating from fundamental value. Prices are subject to fundamental risk, but can move away from fundamental value, irrespective of outcomes in the fundamentals. When an investor buys a stock, she takes on fundamental risk – the stock price could drop because the firm’s operations don’t meet expectations – but she also runs the (price) risk of buying a stock that is overpriced or selling a stock that is underpriced.

***What is the difference between passive investor and active investor?***

A passive investor does not investigate the price at which he buys an investment. He
assumes that the investment is fairly (efficiently) priced and that he will earn the normal return
for the risk he takes on. The active investor investigates whether the investment is efficiently
priced. He looks for mispriced investments that can earn a return in excess of the normal return.

***Should a shareholder be indifferent between selling her shares on the open market and selling them to the firm in a stock repurchase?***

The firm has to repurchase the stock at the market price, so the shareholder will get
the same price from the firm as from another investor. But one should be wary of trading with
insiders (the management) who might have more information about the firm’s prospects than
outsiders (and might make stock repurchases when they consider the stock to be underpriced).
Some argue that stock repurchases are indicative of good prospects for the firm that are not
reflected in the market price, and firms repurchase stocks to signal these prospects. Firms buy
stocks because they think the stock is cheap.
