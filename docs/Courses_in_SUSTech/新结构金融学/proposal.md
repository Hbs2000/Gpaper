# Coronavirus and local government debt

## Motivation

During the past three years when the virus was proliferating, the revenue for local government decreased and meanwhile, the expense soared due to the growing budget assigned to healthcare and its related industries, which gave rise to the burden of local finance, specifically, the growth of local government debt.

It is easy to compute the change in debt, perhaps the main problem is the accessibility of data. However, it is relatively hard to quantify the impact of the long-existing disease. The proxy used is <u>**the total of days for closure and control for cities of medium size or above**.</u>

Here we have two points to clarify:
1. Instead of using the reported number of infected people, we choose the total of days for closure and control. The reason is that the reported number is usually **manipulated due to political concerns**, because it is shown that the scale of infection has a lot of things to do with promotion, as a result, the government tends to cover the news when an epidemic happens.
2. The sample is restricted to cities of medium size or above. The rationale behind this is that the **promotion-driven behavior** of small-sized cities is considered. Even though there is no reported patient within a city, it will shut the city down only because of the epidemic in its neighboring cities. Nevertheless, this phenomenon is alleviated in metropolitans where the development of the economy is more concerned.

Given the above analysis, we propose two hypotheses:
1. The longer the closure of the day, the worse the government finance, which is straightforward.
2. On the contrary, it is the deteriorating finance that will shorten the closure periods because it has to do so. For instance, the case of Foxconn in Zhengzhou.

## The real estate

Moreover, the effects should be more significant for cities that **heavily rely on** the real estate, because this industry accounts for a large part of government finance, and is characterized with that it requires an extremely high turnover of capital to operate, which leads to a dangerous leverage ratio, and that only after the construction needs to be completed can the firm receive the remained cash flow. All of which will give rise to a financial shortage if the construction is suspended.
