The paper brings profound insights into Chinese particular risk over political uncertainty for asset prices, specifically, the stock market. 

Especially, the authors consider the Bo scandal in 2012 as a purely exogenous shock to the Chinese sample. Bo scandal as it stands is the most egregious incident over the past several decades as some of the most influential and powerful people were involved and the scandal is related to the transition of the highest power. Therefore, it triggered an enormous amount of uncertainty and turbulence.

Three proxies, concerning monetary policy, fiscal policy, and political connections, have been proposed for measuring the extent to which Chinese listed companies are related to politics.

The authors analyze the performance before and after the scandal and compare to the other two hypotheses: the decrease in expected cash flow and the reduction of value related to political connections, which finally get the conclusion that the Chinese market has significant political risk, also the corresponding premiums of risk, and that the risk is more severe among those firms which have more political correlations. Moreover, this paper adopts special treatments to overcome the endogeneity problem and conducts a sufficient number of empirical tests, thus the robustness of the results is guaranteed.

However, the less significant outcomes for the other hypotheses do not mean they are valueless. What the authors are trying to argue is the existence of political risk in China. 
Basically, I have two minor comments concerning the treatment of cumulative abnormal return (CAR) from the view of asset pricing and one methodology doubt about the proposed three hypotheses.

First, this paper collects CAR data from individual stock perspective using the following equations:
$$
Ret_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t} + \epsilon_{i,t} \tag{1}
$$
according to the paper, $Ret_{i,t}$, is the return on stock $i$ on day $t$ and $R_{m,t}$ is
the value-weighted market return on day $t$. The model is estimated for each firm over the six-month period (i.e., from August 7, 2011 to February 6, 2012) with a minimum of 100 days prior to the Wang scandal.

And this paper defines abnormal return as:
$$
ARet_{i,t} = Ret_{i,t} - (\hat{\alpha}_i +\hat{\beta}_i R_{m,t}) \tag{2}
$$

where $\hat{\alpha}_i$ and $\hat{\beta}_i$ are the estimated coefficients from the equation (1). Then the authors sum up the returns over the 3-day window for each stock to get the final cumulative abnormal return.

However, it is generally accepted that the signal-to-noise ratio in the financial market data is extremely low, and financial scholars usually take care of the disproportionate amount of noise by forming a portfolio based on relevant variables to ensure the robustness and significance of the statistical outcome.

The insufficient significance of the results in some empirical tests of the article may be due to the absence of the portfolio treatment. Perhaps adding a portfolio robustness test will better back up the papers’ main conclusions. 

Second, besides the comment on noise processing, the way in which this article uses the asset pricing factor model is also worth discussing. 

In this paper, as shown above, Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to calculate parameters and consequent cumulative abnormal return and during this estimating window, those coefficients are assumed to be held constant. 

However, CAPM, as it stands is proposed in 1964 and later financial research has proved that CAPM is not enough for explaining the excess return, which leads to the flourishing of all kinds of multi-factor asset pricing models.

Therefore, the article’s method will lead to a lot of bias when it comes to estimating the CAR since it deems all other possible useful pricing factors which can’t be captured by the market factor and thus are included in alpha are constant, which are not actually.

I recommend the authors could compute the mainstream general pricing factors, for example, SMB and HML, as Fama and French (1993) or Stambough and Yuan (2019) do to get a cleaner and more precise political factor.

Third, this article proposed three hypotheses that correspond to different interpretations such as risk-based explanation, expected cash flow model, and the diminishment of political connections. However, it seems strange that hypotheses two and three are not alternative hypotheses to hypothesis one. In other words, although the two hypotheses do not work out in empirical tests, it does not mean the validity of hypothesis one because there can still be another explanation that is more suitable than the first proposed two.

To conclude, I think that the processing of cumulative abnormal return can be further refined and the hypothesis methodology is not quite logical to me. Nonetheless, the paper itself indeed contributes to the literature on the Chinese corruption topic, and the creativity, as well as the core findings remain, which is sufficient to publish.
