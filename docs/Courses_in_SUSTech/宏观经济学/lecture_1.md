### 12 key ideas that will be covered in this book

- What is produced and consumed in the economy is determined jointly by the economy’s productive capacity and the preferences of consumers
- In free market economies, strong forces tend to produce socially efficient economic outcomes
- Unemployment is painful for individuals, but it is a necessary evil in modern economies
- Improvements in a country’s standard of living are brought about in the long run by technological progress
- A tax cut is not a free lunch
- Credit markets, banks play key roles in the macroeconomy
- What consumers and firms anticipate for the future has an important bearing on current macroeconomic events
- Money takes many forms, and society is much better off with it than without it. Once we have it, however, changing its quantity ultimately does not matter
- Business cycles are similar, but they can have many causes
- Countries gain from trading goods and assets with each other, but trade is also a source of shocks to the domestic economy
- In the long run, inflation is caused by growth in the money supply
- If there is a short-run tradeoff between output and inflation, that has very different implications relative to the relationship between nominal interest rates and inflation

经常账户盈余（赤字）是好还是坏？

1. 个人可以通过借贷smooth consumption，国家也可以通过赤字
   
2. 赤字大也说明国内增长快，需求高
   
3. 好事坏事取决于怎么用，如果钱用来消费掉，那么就有通胀等后果（阿根廷），如果用于高收入投资（productive investment），这种情况下反而有好处
